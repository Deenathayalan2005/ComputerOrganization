DATA HAZARD
Data hazard, it is also known as
dependencies. It occurs in computer
pipelines. It arises when multiple
instructions are executed in different
stages of pipelines.
Data hazard can be resolved by
forwarding ,stalling ,reordering instruction
,software pipelining techniques.
TYPES:
There are three types of data hazard
(i)Read after write(RAW):
This occurs when instruction tries to
read data before a instruction writes it.
(ii)write after read(WAR):
This occurs when instruction write
to a register or memory location. It will not
cause a problem in sequential execution, it
could lead to incorrect behavior.
(iii)Write after Write(WAW):
 This occurs when two instruction
attempt to write to the same location in
memory.
APPLICATIONS:
There are various application in
data hazard :
 Data forwarding: This techniques
allow the processor to forward data
directly from output to the input
pipeline stage.
 Stalling : If hazard is detected the
pipelines can be stalled until the
hazard is resolved.
 Compiler optimization: It can
analyze code to rearrange
instruction to minimize their
impact.
 Pipeline interlocks: It detects the
hazard and stall the pipeline when
necessary to prevent incorrect
execution.
 Embedded systems: Data hazards in
embedded system are critical.
Minimizing hazard can help to
control the performance of
embedded processor.
RECENT TRENDS:
(i)Speculative execution
(ii)Advanced pipelining techniques
 (iii)Energy efficient hazard handling
(iv)Hazard aware programming models
CONCLUSION:
Data hazards are critical in modern
processor device. It arise due to
dependencies between instructions. By
data hazard processor can improve
performance , reliability and energy
efficiently.
